I created a responsive website from scratch using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript on behalf of Dr. Aya Elbrashy for her Skin and Hair Care Diploma.

It is composed of a main introductory page plus 3 pages, one for each section of her diploma, 2 quiz pages, a certificate download page  and a final check-out page with payment details.

An introductory video was embedded with customer reviews, and pictures and links to all the  course videos and pdfs were included.

I used javascript to make the quiz pages access only by providing password.

The certificate is automatically downloaded as a pdf with the users name on it, and I used cookies to prevent redownload of the certificate.

Enrollment prices were illustrated in tables, to make them more  clear to the viewer.

Icons used were obtained from Fonts awesome and  Google icons were also used.

After that, I deployed the website to Netlify for her and I will be undergoing any updates needed as the site grows  in the future.
